## Development

The aim was to create a website using a pre-created template (more information below) for a personal project. The website features a booking app created from scratch. It can be reused quite easily. The deployment was done on heroku and mapped to a Google Domains.

The repository is not ready to be used straight out of the box. However, it should be quite easy to adapt it if you are willing to reuse it. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions / have issues when trying to use this, especially the Booking app.

## Credits

This website was built using the Grayscale Bootstrap template. You can find the template here: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/
